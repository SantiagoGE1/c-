Tests skeleton for El Robo al Tren del Oro

Purpose
- Provide a minimal tests/ folder with a compile-check script and basic instructions.
- We will NOT execute tests automatically. Use these scripts locally on Windows PowerShell when you permit execution.

How to use
- Open PowerShell in the repo root.
- Run the compile check script to attempt compiling the project (requires g++ in PATH).

Notes
- The scripts only try to compile; they do not run the binary.
- If you want automated unit tests later, we can add a small C++ test harness (Catch2 or doctest) and CI config.
